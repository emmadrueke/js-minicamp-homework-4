# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
* `for`:
	A ‘for’ loop is crucial and makes it possible to iterate over each position in a string, an array, and an object to evaluate the data that is at a specific position. 
		
* `&&`, `||`, `!`
	These are just a couple of operators that can be used in ‘if’ statements or ‘for’ loops.
		 &&: means ‘and. The argument that is given to the for loop needs to have both conditions an example is if the number passed from the argument needs to be an even number && be greater than 10. If the number is true for both of those conditions then the code will be told to do something like return true, or print true in the console. 
		||: means ‘or’ it is used similarly to && except that only one of the conditions needs to be true. Using the same example from the && definition, if some number that is passed from the function is even || greater then 10, return true. So only one of those conditions needs to be true in order for the code to continue running.
		!: Means not. It reverses the truthiness of a statement. !true = false. !false = true. !10 = any number but 10. 

* Arrays:
	A list of data. So that could be a list of numbers, a list of strings which could be the names of all your favorite restaurants. It can also have different types of data sets in them like numbers and strings mixed together, but that’s not good practice. It can also be a list of objects, which we’ll talk about in the next homework assignment. 

* Git:
	Git is a place where you can manage you code and all of it’s previous versions. 
		
* GitHub:
	GitHub is the place where you host your code and collaborate with others. 
		



2. Install git.  https://git-scm.c]om/downloads


3. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`


4. Make the tests pass!
